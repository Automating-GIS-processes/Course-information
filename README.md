## GIS with 'pure' Python
  
## Course format

The majority of this course will be spent in front of a computer learning to program in the Python language and working on exercises.
During Teaching Period I, the Automating GIS processes and Introduction to Quantitative Geology courses will meet together and focus on 
learning to program in Python. Previously, both these courses lacked sufficient time for students to properly learn the basic concepts of programming in Python.

The computer exercises will focus on developing basic programming skills using the Python language and applying those skills to various GIS related problems. 
Typical exercises will involve a brief introduction followed by topical computer-based tasks. At the end of the exercises, you may be asked to submit answers 
to relevant questions, some related plots, and/or Python codes you have written or used. You are encouraged to discuss and work together with other students 
on the laboratory exercises, however the laboratory summary write-ups that you submit must be completed individually and must clearly reflect your own work.

## Course topics by week

Topics for Period II will be announced later.
